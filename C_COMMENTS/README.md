In C, comments are used to add human-readable notes and explanations to the source code. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. There are two types of comments in C:

Single-line comments, which begin with the characters // and continue until the end of the line.

Multi-line comments, which begin with the characters /* and end with the characters */. These comments can span multiple lines.

It's considered good practice to use comments to explain the purpose and function of code, and to provide context for how different parts of the program relate to one another.
