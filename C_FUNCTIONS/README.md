In C, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused in multiple places in a program. 

Functions are used to organize and modularize code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and debug. 

Functions can take input in the form of parameters and can return output in the form of a return value.

A function has the following parts:

Function declaration or function prototype: This tells the compiler the function's name, return type, and the types and number of parameters the function takes.check here for the syntax of a function declaration.

Function definition: This is the actual implementation of the function, where you provide the code that the function should execute when it is called. The function definition includes the function header (same as the function declaration) and the function body (the code that the function executes).Check syntax here.

Function call: This is where the function is invoked and executed by the program. The function call includes the function name and the values passed as arguments.check syntax here.
