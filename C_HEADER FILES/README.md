In C, library header files are a collection of pre-written code that can be included in a program to provide additional functionality. 

These files typically have a .h file extension and are stored in a library, a collection of object files that can be linked to a program at compile time. 

Commonly used library headers include:

stdio.h : provides input and output functions such as printf(), scanf(), and file I/O functions

string.h : provides functions for working with strings such as strcpy(), strcmp(), and strlen()

stdlib.h : provides functions for memory allocation, process control, and conversions such as malloc(), exit(), and atoi()

math.h : provides mathematical functions such as sqrt(), sin(), and log()

time.h : provides functions for working with time and date such as time(), localtime(), and mktime()

These headers and the functions they provide are part of the C standard library, which is a set of functions and macros that are defined by the C standard and provided by all C compilers.

You can include these headers in your C program by including them with preprocessor directive #include at the top of your source file. 

This will make the functions defined in the header available for use in your program.
