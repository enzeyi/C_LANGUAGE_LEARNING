//limits.h is a standard C library header that defines various limits and parameters for the implementation of the C language. 
//These limits include the maximum and minimum values for various data types (such as INT_MAX for the maximum value of an int), as well as other implementation-specific details (such as the number of bits in a byte).

//The contents of limits.h are specified by the C standard and should be present in any C implementation. 
//It's commonly used by the programmer in order to write portable code that can work on different platforms with different characteristics.
