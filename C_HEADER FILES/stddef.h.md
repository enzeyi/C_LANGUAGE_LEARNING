"stddef.h" is a standard header in the C programming language that defines several types and macros. It is part of the C Standard Library and is specified by the C standard.

The primary purpose of "stddef.h" is to define the type ptrdiff_t, which represents the difference between two pointers. It also defines the macro NULL, which represents a null pointer constant, and the type size_t, which is used to represent the size of objects in bytes.

In addition to these, "stddef.h" also defines the macro offsetof, which can be used to calculate the offset of a structure member within the structure.

"stddef.h" is a commonly used header in C programming and is frequently included in source code to make use of these types and macros.
