#endif is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to indicate the end of a block of code that is conditionally compiled using the #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef preprocessor directives.

When the preprocessor encounters an #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef directive, it evaluates the condition following the directive. 
If the condition is true, the preprocessor processes the code that follows the directive, up until the corresponding #endif directive. 
If the condition is false, the preprocessor skips over the code between the #if and #endif directives and does not include it in the compiled program.

For example, the following code block will only be included in the compiled program if the constant DEBUG is defined:

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debugging information");
#endif

It's important to match every #if or #ifdef or #ifndef with a corresponding #endif to avoid unexpected behavior
