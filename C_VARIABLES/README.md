In C, a variable is a named storage location in memory that can hold a value of a specific data type. 
Variables are used to store data and values that are used and manipulated by the program.

To declare a variable in C, you need to specify its data type and its name. 

The data type determines the kind of value that the variable can hold, such as an integer, a floating-point number, a character, etc. 
The name of the variable is a user-defined identifier that is used to refer to the variable in the program.
