In C, a variable is a named storage location in memory that can hold a value of a specific data type. 
Variables are used to store data and values that are used and manipulated by the program.

To declare a variable in C, you need to specify its data type and its name. 

The data type determines the kind of value that the variable can hold, such as an integer, a floating-point number, a character, etc. 
The name of the variable is a user-defined identifier that is used to refer to the variable in the program.

In C, variable names are case-sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered to be different. Therefore, a variable name can be uppercase or lowercase or combination of both. However, it is a common practice to use lowercase letters for variable names. This is because the C programming language traditionally uses uppercase letters for macro definitions and uppercase letters are also used to indicate constants. Using lowercase letters for variable names makes it easier to distinguish between variables and constants.

Also, it is important to note that C has some naming conventions, most common one is to use snake_case for variable and function names, and use ALL_CAPS for macro names. By following these conventions, your code will be more readable and understandable for other developers who might work on the same codebase.
