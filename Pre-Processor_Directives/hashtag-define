#define is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to define a constant or macro. 
It is typically used at the beginning of a program or in a header file. 
For example, #define PI 3.14 would define the constant PI with a value of 3.14. 
This constant can then be used throughout the program in place of the actual value. 
When the program is compiled, the preprocessor replaces all instances of PI with 3.14
