#if

#if is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to conditionally compile code based on the evaluation of a specific expression. 
The directive takes the form of #if expression, where expression is any valid C or C++ expression that can be evaluated to either true or false.

When the preprocessor encounters an #if directive, it evaluates the expression following the directive. 
If the expression evaluates to true, the preprocessor processes the code that follows the directive, up until the corresponding #endif directive. 
If the expression evaluates to false, the preprocessor skips over the code between the #if and #endif directives and does not include it in the compiled program.

For example, the following code block will only be included in the compiled program if the constant DEBUG is defined and the variable x is greater than 5:

#if defined(DEBUG) && x > 5
    printf("Debugging information");
#endif

It's important to match every #if with a corresponding #endif to avoid unexpected behavior.
