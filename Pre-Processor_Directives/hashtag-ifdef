#ifdef is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to conditionally compile code based on whether a specific symbol has been defined. 
The directive takes the form of #ifdef symbol, where symbol is the name of the symbol that is being checked for.

When the preprocessor encounters an #ifdef directive, it checks to see if the specified symbol has been defined earlier in the program, either by a #define directive or by a compiler option. 
If the symbol has been defined, the preprocessor processes the code that follows the directive, up until the corresponding #endif directive. 
If the symbol has not been defined, the preprocessor skips over the code between the #ifdef and #endif directives and does not include it in the compiled program.

For example, the following code block will only be included in the compiled program if the symbol DEBUG has been defined:

#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debugging information");
#endif

It's important to match every #ifdef with a corresponding #endif to avoid unexpected behavior
