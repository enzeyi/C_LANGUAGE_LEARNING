#ifndef is a preprocessor directive in C and C++ that is used to check whether a particular header file has been included before in the current source file or not.
It is typically used at the beginning of header files to prevent multiple inclusion of the same header file.

The #ifndef directive is used in conjunction with the #define directive. 
The #define directive is used to define a preprocessor macro, typically with the same name as the header file. 
The #ifndef directive checks whether the macro has been defined already, and if not, the code between the #ifndef and the following #endif is processed.

For example, in a header file named "myheader.h", you might have the following code at the beginning of the file:


#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

// header file contents here

#endif

This way, if the "myheader.h" file is included multiple times in the same source file, the code between the #ifndef and the #endif will only be processed once.

This is also known as header guards, it's a common practice to protect header files from multiple inclusion
