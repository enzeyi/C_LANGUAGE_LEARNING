# SPEAKING_C
This is all that I think I know about the C Programming Language. Public or Private Repo? Public. YES! Have a look!
But first,let me tell you a short story between me and C.
I begun learning how to program in C in the latest month of the year 2022.
I wrote my first "Hello World!" program on 01/12/2022.
I've had alot of fun learning and writing C programs. Still, I'm writing more.
