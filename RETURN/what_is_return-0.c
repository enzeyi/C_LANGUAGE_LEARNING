//In C, the return 0; statement is typically used at the end of the main() function to indicate that the program has completed successfully and to exit the program. 
//The 0 value is passed as the return value of the main() function to the operating system or the environment, indicating that the program ran without any errors.

//Maybe you're asking, what is main() function?
//The main() function is a special function in C, as it is the starting point of a C program. 
//The operating system or environment calls the main() function when the program starts running.

//The return type of the main() function is int, which means that it can return an integer value. 
//By convention, a return value of 0 is used to indicate that the program ran successfully, while any non-zero value indicates an error.

//Is it a must to use return 0;
//The return 0; statement is not mandatory, if it's not present the program will terminate successfully as well. 
//However, it's a good practice to include it, as it makes the program's intention clear and it allows for easier debugging in case of unexpected termination

//It's important to note that in case of other functions, the return type is not always int. 
//It depends on the function's definition, it could be any other data types like float, double or void (which doesn't return any value)
